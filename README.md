# Analysis of Stack-Overflow Survey Data

## Installation

- Python (version 3.6.10)
- Jupyter notebook `pip install jupyterlab`
- MatplotLib `pip install matplotlib`
- Numpy `pip install numpy`
- Pandas `pip install pandas`
- Seaborn `pip install seaborn`
- Collections (pre-installed with both python2 and python3)

## Project Motivation

This project aims to verify if the most common stereotypes about computer programmers are true.
Questions to answer
1. What is the language most popular among developers and how has this changed across the years? Is python the most used language?  
2. What Operating System do programmers prefer to use? Is it windows?  
3 .What educational background do programming professionals have and does this have an impact on salary in 2020? Can people who don't have a master's or a Doctoral degree become programmers as well?  

## File Descriptions

- The zip files contain the Stack Overflow Survey data in .csv format for years 2016-2020
- The .ipynb file is the workhorse of the project which contains the code for gathering, assessing, cleaning and visualising the data

## Working/ Interacting with project

1. Clone the project onto your local machine
2. In your terminal/cmd prompt, run `jupyter notebook`
3. Open the .ipynb file using the UI opened.
4. Run each code chunk and replicate the work

## Summary

The project analyses the Stack Overflow Survey Data to answer questions posed in the Motivation section.
Upon analysis it was seen that
- C and Java are the most used language in the time period 2016-2020.  
- Windows is the preffered OS for professional developers.  
- There are many programmers without prestegious degrees and a higher degree doesn't always guarantee a higher paying job.  

## Acknowledgements

The data for this project was obtained from Stack-Overflow with the help of Udacity, as a part of a Nano-Degree Program
